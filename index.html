            Welcome to Breakpoint Buddy, a fast and easy Media Query Tester that helps you test responsive breakpoints and CSS media queries right in your browser.
        </p>
        <p class="documentation">
            This script tests a series of media queries on your device using 
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia">
                <span class="code">matchMedia()</span></a>,
            then prints the results in a table. It's a handy way to see which media queries and values match on a
            device, and since it tests a variety of values for each query on the device, it can show the minimum and
            maximum values for the query that match, e.g. the exact values that match for
            <span class="code">(min-width: ...)</span>. For ranges printed in the <span class="reference">Matched
            Values</span> column, both values are inclusive.
        </p>
        <p class="documentation">
            Note: Media queries are tested every second. If you resize the window or change the zoom level, the media
            queries will be recalculated.
        </p>
        <p class="documentation">
            One of the media features tested is <span class="code">@media (scripting: none)</span>. If this matches,
            then JavaScript is disabled and the table can't be populated, so you'll never see that particular match in
            the table.
        </p>
        <table id="query-list">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Media Query</th>
                    <th>Matched Value(s)</th>
                    <th>Values Tested</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
